# Seaport-Project
Object Oriented and Concurrent Programming course semester project

This project was split into four parts to be completed throughout the 8 week semester. To summarize, this program reads in a formatted
data file and generates a world containing seaports, docks, ships, people. After reading in the file, it begins to simulate ships
arriving at a dock and completing work. Each job requires a person with a special skillset and will only be completed if that person
is at the port they docked at.

# Project Sections:
1. Read a data file, create the internal data structure, create a GUI to display the structure, and let
the user search the structure.
2. Sort the structure, use hash maps to create the structure more efficiently.
3. Create a thread for each job, cannot run until a ship has a dock, create a GUI to show the
progress of each job.
4. Simulate competing for resources (persons with particular skills) for each job.
